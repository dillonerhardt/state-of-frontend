# The State of Frontend

---

## Who am I?

<Steps>


- Self-taught developer
- Previously: Tech Lead at Cognizant
- Senior UI Architect at IHS Markit

</Steps>


<Notes>
  My name is Dillon Erhardt Leading front end on for the EDM product with the
  goal of creating a unified customer experience across a range of products.
</Notes>

### What I'm going to talk about?

How we manage state in modern frontend applications and how that can impact the development of your project.

<Notes>
  This applied to most types of applications. The current JavaScript ecosystem
  seems to struggle with it more. Caused by the move from server side
  applications to having more logic on the front end.
</Notes>

---

### Different types of state

To be able properly manage our state we need to first understand the different types of state in our application.

<Steps>


- UI state
- Navigation state
- Business state

</Steps>


<Notes>
  For the lack of a better name. Generally speaking This isn't exact this is
  just the general pattern most web applications will follow.
</Notes>

---

### UI State

This usually includes state for forms, data fetching and layout.

This type of state will live on the client\*

<Notes></Notes>

---

### Navigation state

Where we keep track of which part of the application the user is on.

This type of state lives in the URL bar\*

<Notes>
  Basically what's in the URL bar - that's a little simplified. This is a good
  example of how viewing it seperatly to a state management solution forces
  developers to not use it for the wrong state.
</Notes>

---

### Business State

For most applications this makes up the majority of the state.

It also happens to be where we see the most issues.

This type of state will generally live on the backend\*

<Notes>
  Only talking about frontend in this talk backend can mean a lot of things. You
  may have noticed the *s that's because there are many exceptions. This will
  generally live on the server. Those issues arise from the move to more logic
  living on the client.
</Notes>

---

### Exceptions

There are times when we need to blur the lines a little bit for performance or architecture reasons.

<Steps>


- Applications with heavy front end logic
- Offline first applications
- Games

</Steps>


<Notes>
  In these scenarios we may sync the data between to the server or cache
  locally. You should still aim to keep these seperated.
</Notes>

---

### State management solutions and their problems

Most projects I see have only one state management solution.

Let's take Redux as an example.

<Notes>
  Picking Redux as it's the most common and has implementations in multiple
  languages. This is usually seen as good practice as it avoids multiple sources
  of truth. Problem is people expect it to work for all types of state.
</Notes>

---

### How this affects development

The way you manage state in an application has a much wider impact than you would expect.

<Steps>


- Story splitting
- Architecture decisions
- Team structure
- Testing

</Steps>


<Notes></Notes>

---

### How you can solve this

Tooling is key. Make your developers lives easier.

<Notes>
  Caching for data is still something to think about. Recent debate on Twitter
  with Mark Erikson and Tanner Linsley. These can be abstractions on top of a
  solution like Redux. We like to think that as an application evolves we will
  improve the core code but usually it is very hard to change, this is
  especially true for large engineering teams so it's important to get it right
  early on.
